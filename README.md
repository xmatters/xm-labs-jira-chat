# Jira Server - Chat
This is a replacement to the existing [Jira Server](https://www.xmatters.com/integration/jira-server/) integration. This version adds a drop down to the engage panel for an option to post to a chat room. The code assumes the chat room name will match the Jira issue number. 

> **Note** This integration has not been maintained and should be considered deprecated.
